## Description

This technical course covers the core Docker and Kubernetes concepts and guides you to build containers. Developers, DevOps, SREs and I.T. Pros will learn how to use containers locally. You’ll experience several demos and hands-on exercises throughout the course as you learn how to build and deploy containers. No coding experience is required for the hands-on activities but you’ll use the terminal, command prompt and VS Code extensively.

You’ll learn about microservices and their use cases. You’ll then learn about containers and Kubenernetes. You’ll learn how to deploy and manage microservices applications packaged in containers locally. This will provide you the essential foundation that you’ll need before heading to the cloud.
